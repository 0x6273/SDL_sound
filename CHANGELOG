/*
 * CHANGELOG.
 */

09132001 - Initial spec proposed on SDL mailing list, under name "SDL_voice".
09142001 - Changed name to SDL_sound, added Sound_DecodeAll() to spec.
09172001 - Changed some overlooked "voice" to "sound". Implemented base API.
           So...tired. Everything's different.  :)
           Also put in a RAW decoder and a simple test program.
09182001 - Implemented MP3 support through SMPEG (not working yet, though) and
           wrote the Reference Counting RWops wrapper. Added other little
           things like the _D(()) macro. Added VOC support, which went up with
           surprisingly little struggle, which means it MUST be leaking
           memory.  :)
09192001 - Added a skeleton decoder source file. Changed voc_read() to
           voc_read_waveform(), so it wouldn't be confused with VOC_read().
           Fixed a byte ordering bug in voc.c (reported as AUDIO_S16LSB, but
           we were swapping byte order of data ourselves. Fixed). Added basic
           .WAV support. Fixed Makefile so that -I. is always first;
           otherwise, a previously installed header might get used for the
           compiles, which is not good. SDL_sound.h now includes SDL_endian.h,
           since SDL.h doesn't, for some reason.
