/*
 * CHANGELOG.
 */

09132001 - Initial spec proposed on SDL mailing list, under name "SDL_voice".
09142001 - Changed name to SDL_sound, added Sound_DecodeAll() to spec.
09172001 - Changed some overlooked "voice" to "sound".
09182001 - Implemented base API. So...tired. Everything's different.  :)
           Also put in a RAW decoder and a simple test program.
