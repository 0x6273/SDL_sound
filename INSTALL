Building is very easy.


ALL PLATFORMS:

Please understand your rights and mine: read the text file LICENSE in the root

The best documentation for the SDL_sound API is SDL_sound.h. It is VERY
heavily commented, and makes an excellent, in-depth reference to all the
functions.


UNIX:

Edit "Makefile", and follow the instructions. The defaults are probably okay
for general purposes, but give it a once over to make sure.

run "make"

That's it. The library will be sitting in a new directory called "bin".

Run "make install" to install the library for use on your system.



OTHER PLATFORMS:

Send me patches, and instructions, and I'll list them here.
